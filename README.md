## :star2: About the Project

Sanguosha was a popular Chinese board game, and [QSanguosha](https://github.com/Mogara/QSanguosha) is an open-source
implementation of the game made by [Mogara](https://github.com/Mogara).

After many years of silence, we decided to adapt the game to a web application with modern technologies.
That's why this project is founded. 
We name this project OpenSGS with the hope that QSanguosha's honorable community can be recovered one day. 
Instead of letting commercial business keep harming Sanguosha, we are acting to help people enjoy the original game.

This repository contains only the client/frontend. Find the backend at [OpenSGS](https://github.com/Mogara/OpenSGS).
